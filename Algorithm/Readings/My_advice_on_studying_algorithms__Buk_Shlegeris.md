Buck Shlegeris

### How to study

1. learn all of the classic algorithm and data structure material
2. be able to quickly produce algorithmic logic on a whiteboard under pressure

---



#### <u>A. Canonical algorithms material</u>

##### 1. list of data structure material

> - `List structures`: arrays, dynamic arrays, linked lists
> - `Set and map structures`: hash maps, binary search trees, heaps
>
> for each : how all of it's essential methods are implemented and their runtimes

#####  2. be able to implement following algorithms

> - `Graph algorithms`: Breadth first search, depth first search, Dijkstra’s algorithm
> - `One fast sorting algorithm`; recommend mergesort or quicksort
> - `Binary search on an array`. it’s worth writing the code even if you roughly understand the algorithm.

#####  3. roughly comfortable with Big O notation



#### <u>B. Canonical algorithmic skills</u>

##### 1. most common central components of algorithms interview problems

> - `Dynamic programming`
> - `Recursion`: Cracking the Coding Interview 참고
> - `Iterating around and over the famous data structures`
> - `Composing fast data structures for a problem`. [Here are some examples](https://github.com/bshlgrs/data-structure-composer/blob/master/amazing_outcome.md) of this kind of problem.

#####  2. practice under real pressure
